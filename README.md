# predict_housing_prices
This repository contains the python code I wrote to predict what housing prices would be based off certain housing characteristic. I used a random forests regression model from the sklearn library and achieved a training score of 97% and a test set score of 84%. This was a beginner level Kaggle project in machine learning.
